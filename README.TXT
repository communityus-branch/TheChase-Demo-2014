"The Chase" mobile demo circa 2013 developed by Unity Technologies.
Official site: https://unity3d.com/pages/the-chase

DISCLAIMER:
USE ON YOUR OWN RISK! Project is very old, undocumented, requires Unity 4.5 and
relies on two commercial Asset Store packages which had to be removed from this repository:
1) SuperSplinePro
2) Marmoset (was only used for prototyping, but final might have some tiny accidental dependancy)
This project will NOT BE MAINTAINED. Most likely it will NOT even COMPILE. You have been warned!

PURPOSE:
Use only for learning or to scavenge assets. Might have some interest for code archeologists too :)
